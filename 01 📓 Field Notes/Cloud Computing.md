- Cloud computing refers to data and applications being stored and run on the cloud rather than your own local computer. 

# Cloud
- The cloud is just a big building filled with computers (servers). 

## What is the purpose of a cloud?
- The companies that own these clouds are called cloud providers and they provide cloud services

## Why cloud computing?
- Cost - a person or company eliminates a lot of the expense of buying own hardware and software, along with the building, maintenance, and electricity it takes to run own data center
- Reliability - cloud providers are responsible for all of the data backups and recovery. If one of the data centers goes down, several redundant sites exist as backup, this ensures that there is no downtime. 
- Scalability - pay-as-you-go method. You only pay cloud storage that you use. 

## Major cloud providers
- (AWS) Amazon Web Services - 1/3 cloud market share
- Microsoft Azure

- Alibaba
- IBM
