Cloud computing refers to data and applications being stored and run on the cloud rather than your own local computer. 

The cloud is just a big building filled with computers (servers). 

What is the purpose of a cloud?
The companies that own these clouds are called cloud providers

Why cloud computing?
- Cost - a person or company eliminates a lot of the expense of buying own hardware and software, along with the building, maintenance, and electricity it takes to run own data center
- Reliability - cloud providers are responsible for all of the data backups and recovery. one of data centers goes down several redundant sites as a backup ensures there is no downtime
- Scalability - pay as you go method. you only pay cloud storage that you use

Examples of major cloud providers
Amazon web services 1/3 cloud market share
microsoft azure
google cloud platform
alibaba
ibm
