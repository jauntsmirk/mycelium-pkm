_A private operating system for learning, thinking, and growth — expressed through passion, governed by logic._

## I. Ontological Premise

Knowledge does not grow linearly.  
It propagates, branches, decomposes, recombines, and resurfaces.

This system models knowledge as **fungal ecology**:
- Invisible most of the time
- Networked beneath the surface
- Expressed through occasional, visible fruiting

The vault known as **Mycelium** exists to support this ecology.

---

## II. Core Law

> **Folders are metaphorical habitats.**  
> **Notes are explicit scientific specimens.**

Metaphor governs _where_ things live.  
Clarity governs _what_ things are.

---

## III. Taxonomy of the Vault

The vault is ordered numerically to reflect the lifecycle of knowledge:  
**capture → input → network → abstraction → evolution → output → decay**.

---

### 00 🧭 Maps

_(Orientation layer)_

**Function:** Navigation and sense-making.

Maps are deliberately constructed paths through the system. They contain links, not raw knowledge.

**Law:** Maps reveal structure; they do not store substance.

---

### 01 📓 Field Notes

_(Capture layer)_

**Function:** Immediate observation.

Field Notes are written in real time, during learning, confusion, or insight. They are allowed to be incomplete and unrefined.

**Law:** Capture precedes clarity.

---

### 02 📚 Substrate

_(Nutrient sources — raw input)_

**Function:** Absorption.

Substrate contains external material that feeds the system: courses, books, papers, and lectures. Content here is not yet integrated.

**Law:** No idea is considered understood while it lives only in Substrate.

---

### 03 🌱 Rhizomorphic Network

_(Areas — sustained domains of life)_

**Function:** Long-term maintenance.

The Rhizomorphic Network represents persistent areas of responsibility and study. These domains have no fixed end date.

**Law:** If it must be maintained over time, it belongs here.

---

### 04 🧠 Spores

_(Concepts — atomic ideas)_

**Function:** Propagation.

Spores are small, resilient units of thought that can link across domains and projects.

**Law:** When an idea appears in multiple contexts, it is extracted into a Spore.

---

### 05 🧬 Genetic Material

_(Experiments, mutations, lineage)_

**Function:** Evolution.

This layer holds tentative ideas, experiments, and variations. Nothing here is expected to survive unchanged.

**Law:** Evolution requires risk and variation.

---

### 06 🍄 Fruiting Bodies

_(Projects — visible output)_

**Function:** Expression.

A Fruiting Body is any effort with a defined beginning and end that produces observable output.

**Law:** When fruiting completes, the body decomposes.

---

### 07 🪵 Saprotrophic Layer

_(Archive — decomposition and recycling)_

**Function:** Decay.

Completed projects, obsolete notes, and past semesters are stored here. Nothing is deleted; everything decomposes into nutrients for future growth.

**Law:** Decay is not failure; it is reuse.

---

## IV. Rules of Practice

1. Write to understand, not to record.
2. Prefer linking over duplication.
3. Let structure grow slower than knowledge.
4. Refactor deliberately and infrequently.
5. Protect clarity over aesthetics (function over form).

---

## V. Amendment Protocol

This Constitution is designed to be stable, not static.
Amendments are permitted under the following conditions:
1. An amendment is made deliberately, not reactively.
2. An amendment reflects sustained usage over time, not a single moment of friction.
3. An amendment clarifies existing structure rather than multiplying it.

All amendments must be:
- Dated
- Briefly justified
- Additive or corrective, never cosmetic

Amendments are recorded at the end of this document under a clearly labeled section.

## VI. Closing Principle

This system is not a monument.  
It is a living organism.

If it grows, it is correct.  
If it adapts, it is healthy.  
If it supports future fruiting, it is successful.
